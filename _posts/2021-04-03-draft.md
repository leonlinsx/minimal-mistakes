## 1.

I've heard about [ergodicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_process "wiki") before, but wasn't quite able to understand it until I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCb2AMN87cg "youtube") by Ergodicity TV. It's an important concept but seems more widely known in physics than in finance. I want to try explaining it in my own words below.

We're familiar with different types of "averages" - mean, median, mode \[1\]. Let's focus on mean for today, and take it as the expected value of some random event \[2\]. Depending on what expected value we take, we can get drastically different results.

**Ergodicity means that the ensemble average is the same as the time average.** Something being non-ergodic means the opposite, that the ensemble average is not the time average.

Yeah, I'm not sure what ensemble and time here mean \[3\] either, so let's look at an example of tossing a coin.

Suppose some random dude tosses a coin 5 times, getting some heads and some tails. We can calculate the time average for this simulation, getting the average number of heads. In this case there are 3 heads out of 5 tosses, so that's 0.6 heads.

Suppose we get a few more people to toss coins as well. That gets us a situation like the below, where I'm representing heads as 1 and tails as 0:

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ergodicity/a16z gaming market size.png)

There are two types of averages we can use here. The first is the time average from before, where we get the **average over some period of time for one person.**

The second is the ensemble average, where we get the **average over one period of time for multiple people.**

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ergodicity/a16z gaming market size.png)

The big question that ergodicity tries to answer is: **Should we expect these two averages to be the same?**

If we think for a while, we'll be able to reason that we should for this example. A coin toss is random, and doesn't depend on the previous result. The ensemble average is the same as the time average. In the long run, we'd also expect these averages to be 0.5 \[4\].

That was a lot of words to show something you probably already believed, so why do I think this is so important?

Let's build on the example, by having the people bet on the coin toss. Everyone starts with $1, gets 50% profit if they win, and pays 40% of their bet if they lose. For example:

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ergodicity/a16z gaming market size.png)

Rather than plot the coin toss results themselves, let's think about the wealth that each person will have. If we plot these, **should we expect the time average of one person's wealth to be the same as the ensemble average of everyone's wealth?**

Or put another way: would you want to take such a bet? 

The expected value of such a bet is 50% times $1.50, plus 50% times $0.60, to get $1.05. With a positive expected value, it seems like we should keep betting. Let's simulate some coin tosses to see what happens.

I've coded a simulation of coin tossing in this jupyter notebook \[5\]. Running the above scenario for one person doing 100 coin flips, we notice that their wealth increases to as much as $4, before falling to essentially $0.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ergodicity/a16z gaming market size.png)

Hmm, maybe we got an unlucky scenario. Let's repeat this with 100 people instead, still doing 100 coin flips. I'll also calculate the average wealth at each coin flip and represent that with a dashed red line. 

The two graphs below are identical in data; I'm just rescaling with a logarithmic axis for better visualisation.

![post]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/ergodicity/a16z gaming market size.png)

Something strange is happening. We see that one lucky outlier who got to $1k in wealth, and also see that the average wealth (dashed red line) is continously increasing. However, notice that **the majority of these people lost money!** In this simulation, 94 out of the 100 people who played ended up with less than the $1 they started with.

If you're not convinced, the notebook also has an example with one thousand people; you can also adjust the parameters to play around.

What we're seeing is that even though the expected value is positive, and the ensemble average is increasing, the time average for any single person is 
decreasing. **The average of the entire "system" increases, but that doesn't mean that the average of a single unit is increasing.** Large outliers skew the average, but the majority of people are not winning.
