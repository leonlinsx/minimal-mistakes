## 1.

I've heard about [ergodicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_process "wiki") before, but wasn't quite able to understand it until I watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCb2AMN87cg "youtube") by Ergodicity TV. It's an important concept but seems more widely known in physics than in finance. I want to try explaining it in my own words below.

We're familiar with different types of "averages" - mean, median, mode \[1\]. Let's focus on mean for today, and take it as the expected value of some random event \[2\]. Depending on what expected value we take, we can get drastically different results.

**Ergodicity means that the ensemble average is the same as the time average.** Something being non-ergodic means the opposite, that the ensemble average is not the time average.

Yeah, I'm not sure what ensemble and time here mean \[3\] either, so let's look at an example of tossing a coin.

Suppose some random dude tosses a coin 5 times, getting some heads and some tails. We can calculate the time average for this simulation, getting the average number of heads. In this case there are 3 heads out of 5 tosses, so that's 0.6 heads.

Suppose we get a few more people to toss coins as well. That gets us a situation like the below, where I'm representing heads as 1 and tails as 0:

There are two types of averages we can use here. The first is the time average from before, where we get the **average over some period of time for one person.**

The second is the ensemble average, where we get the **average over one period of time for multiple people.**

The big question that ergodicity tries to answer is: Should we expect these two averages to be the same?

If we think for a while, we'll be able to reason that we should for this example. A coin toss is random, and doesn't depend on the previous result. The ensemble average is the same as the time average. In the long run, we'd also expect these averages to be 0.5 \[4\].

That was a lot of words to show something you probably already believed, so why do I think this is so important?

Let's build on the example, by having the people bet on the coin toss. Everyone will start with $1. They'll get 50% profit if they win, and pay 40% of their bet if they lose. For example:

Rather than plot the coin toss results themselves, let's think about the wealth that each person will have. If we plot these, should we expect the time average of one person's wealth to be the same as the ensemble average of everyone's wealth?

1. In case you need a refresher, [the mean is the average where you add all numbers up and divide by the count of numbers, the median is the middle number, and the mode is the most common number](https://www.purplemath.com/modules/meanmode.htm "stats")
