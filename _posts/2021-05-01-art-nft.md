I started learning art history a while ago, to better understand what I was looking at in museums. That turned into learning how to draw, to better appreciate art history. With the recent non-fungible tokens (NFTs) trend, I wanted to share what I learnt about art today, and then discuss NFTs in a follow up post \[1\].

## 1. What is pure art?

I've been primarily using [smarthistory](https://smarthistory.org/ "smart") to learn art history, though the video that kickstarted my journey was [this MoMa one on how to paint like Picasso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGZYfSzvPvs&list=PLfYVzk0sNiGEZXlIltPP7Yy_s5gTM7hf8 "moma"). I've also touched on art history before with articles on [Picasso](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/picassos-new-painting-perspectives "picasso") and [Manet](https://avoidboringpeople.substack.com/p/manet-and-modernity "manet").

**The most important thing I learnt about art history is to be open-minded.** 

Here's what I mean:

Suppose someone were to come to you and say, "I'm sick of fake art, I want to see real, pure art."

What would you show them?

Perhaps you would show them [The School of Athens,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_of_Athens "school") a painting by Raphael during the height of the Italian Renaissance in the 1500s. With its realistic potrayal of famous philosophers and use of [linear perspective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perspective_(graphical) "perspective") to make things look 3D, the famous fresco is seen as a masterpiece epitomising the Renaissance.

Or perhaps you'd reject historical subjects as boring, thinking that art shouldn't need to have a moral lesson attached. Instead, you show a 1800s painting by Dominique Ingres that's pure pleasure and fantasy. [La Grand Odalisque looks realistic on first glance, but taking a closer look shows that the spine is weirdly long, and the back leg is attached at a weird angle.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grande_Odalisque "wiki") Despite its fakeness, it's gone on to inspire many other artists.

You might say that pleasure is superficial, and it's purer to commemorate modern suffering, such as in Goya's 1800s [The Third of May](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_of_May_1808 "may"). It's less realistic than the works earlier, with the figures being flatter and less finished. Yet it was so different from previous artwork that it's been called "one of the first paintings of the modern era."

purity in art

naturalism

picasso, perspectives

gauguin, primitive

abstraction


I don't get a lot of it, but I don't have to.

## 2. 



As part of my neverending quest to stop getting stereotyped \[20\], I started learning to draw last year. Other reasons included:

- I wanted to better appreciate how artists were creating their work, and distinguish between skill and bullshit
- As I thought about skills that I could work on for a long time, even up till old age, drawing fit
- another way to express myself and communicate

I started with [draw a box](https://drawabox.com/ "draw"), and then moved on to [New Masters Academy](https://www.nma.art/ "nma"), which I'm still using \[21\]. I mainly work with pencil and fountain pen \[22\].

It's my newsletter, I get to show off once in a while.


Roughly a year and 600 pieces of paper later \[23\], here's a progress pic:

And these are some things I've learnt along the way:

drawing is a skill

tools, no rules

not copying

medium makes a difference

small things make a difference

drawing stands alone

## Footnotes

1. Yes, I missed my deadline to get everything done in one post. In my defense, I've been busy snacking.
20. To mixed success, tbh.
21. I used [quickposes](https://quickposes.com/ "qp") to practice gesture as well, but as of this week it seems the site is down permanently. Pity.
22. I use a range of Staedtler Mars Lumograph from 3H to 8B (though I don't use darks as often), a kneaded eraser, a stump, and a fine tip Pilot Metropolitan.
23. I mainly practiced in a 200 page sketchbook, and went through 3 of those plus a bit more. For those that are really interested for some reason [here's a link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JuCf-pNB8amh2xsFSYmXyuNWUd5oBv8j?usp=sharing "link") to all the sketches I've done. The pages are out of order though as I had difficulties while scanning them in.
