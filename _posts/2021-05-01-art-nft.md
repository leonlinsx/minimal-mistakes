I started learning art history a while ago, to better understand what I was looking at in museums. That turned into learning how to draw, to better appreciate art technique. With the recent non-fungible tokens (NFTs) trend, today I want to discuss what I learnt about art history, art, and NFTs.

It's my newsletter, I get to show off once in a while.

## 1.

I've been primarily using [smarthistory](https://smarthistory.org/ "smart") to learn.

**The most important thing I learnt about art history is to be open-minded.** 

Here's what I mean:

purity in art

naturalism

picasso, perspectives

gauguin, primitive

abstraction

I don't get a lot of it, but I don't have to.

## 2. 

As part of my neverending quest to stop getting stereotyped \[20\], I started learning to draw last year. Other reasons included:

- I wanted to better appreciate how artists were creating their work, and distinguish between skill and bullshit
- As I thought about skills that I could work on for a long time, even up till old age, drawing fit
- another way to express myself and communicate

I started with [draw a box](https://drawabox.com/ "draw"), and then moved on to [New Masters Academy](https://www.nma.art/ "nma"), which I'm still using \[21\]. I mainly work with pencil and fountain pen \[22\].

Roughly a year and 600 pieces of paper later \[23\], here's a progress pic:

And these are some things I've learnt along the way:

drawing is a skill

tools, no rules

not copying

medium makes a difference

small things make a difference

drawing stands alone

## Footnotes

20. To mixed success, tbh.
21. I used [quickposes](https://quickposes.com/ "qp") to practice gesture as well, but as of this week it seems the site is down permanently. Pity.
22. I use a range of Staedtler Mars Lumograph from 3H to 8B (though I don't use darks as often), a kneaded eraser, a stump, and a fine Pilot Metropolitan.
23. I mainly practiced in a 200 page sketchbook, and went through 3 of those plus a bit more. For those that are really interested [here's a link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JuCf-pNB8amh2xsFSYmXyuNWUd5oBv8j?usp=sharing "link") to all the sketches I've done. The pages are out of order though as I had difficulties while scanning them in.
